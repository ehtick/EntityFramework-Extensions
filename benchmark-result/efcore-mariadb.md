## üèÅ Conclusion

Across all tested operations on **MariaDB**, Entity Framework Extensions consistently outperforms EF Core:  

* **Performance:** EF Extensions methods execute dramatically faster, particularly in large batch operations.  
* **Memory Usage:** In most cases, EF Extensions also consumes significantly less memory, though on MariaDB some variations show memory usage closer to EF Core.  
* **Features:** For operations like **Bulk Synchronize**, EF Extensions provides functionality that EF Core does not natively support.  

For developers working with **MariaDB**, EF Extensions delivers a major boost in performance and efficiency, making it especially valuable for applications handling high-volume data workloads.
