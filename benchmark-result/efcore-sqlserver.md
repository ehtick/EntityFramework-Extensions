## üèÅ Conclusion

Across all tested operations on **SQL Server**, Entity Framework Extensions consistently outperforms EF Core:

* **Performance:** EF Extensions methods complete in a fraction of the time compared to EF Core.
* **Memory Usage:** In most cases, EF Extensions also consumes far less memory, reducing pressure on the GC and improving overall scalability.
* **Features:** For certain scenarios like **Bulk Synchronize**, EF Extensions provides capabilities that EF Core does not offer at all.

For applications that need to process large datasets efficiently, EF Extensions delivers both speed and reliability, making it a strong choice for developers looking to push EF Core beyond its default limits.
