## üèÅ Conclusion

Across all tested operations on **SQLite**, Entity Framework Extensions provides consistent performance improvements over EF Core:  

* **Performance:** EF Extensions operations complete much faster, even on lightweight databases like SQLite.  
* **Memory Usage:** EF Extensions generally uses less memory, though on very small datasets the difference is less pronounced.  
* **Features:** Exclusive operations such as **Bulk Synchronize** are available only with EF Extensions.  

For developers using **SQLite**, EF Extensions offers reliable performance boosts and efficiency improvements, especially valuable for applications that manipulate many records locally.
