## 🏁 Conclusion

Across all providers, **Bulk Insert with Entity Framework Extensions** shows dramatic performance improvements compared to EF Core:  

* **Performance:** In every database tested, EF Extensions executes inserts several times faster than EF Core, especially at higher entity counts.  
* **Memory Usage:** EF Extensions usually consumes less memory, though results vary slightly across providers (Oracle tends to be closer to EF Core).  
* **Scalability:** Complex scenarios such as inserts with graph or keep identity benefit greatly from EF Extensions, making it the preferred choice for bulk operations.  

For applications where **insert performance** is critical, EF Extensions provides consistent speed and efficiency gains across all major database providers.
